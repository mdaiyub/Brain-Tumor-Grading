# Glioma Tumor Grading

I extracted the tumor features according to the data annotation of all four stages of 3D MRI data. And I deployed Graph Neural Networks based on important features such as First Order Statistics, Shape-based (3D), Shape-based (2D), GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZN, NGTDM, and GLDM. Afterward, a graph neural network to differentiate the grade of glioma tumor.
